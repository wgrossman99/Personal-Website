      <h2>My Classics Studies</h2>
      <p class="text">I have taken 3 years of Latin at Roxbury Latin, and am planning on beginning to study Ancient Greek in the fall. I believe that my knowledge of classics had been helpful in a variety of ways, as it has improved my vocabulary, honed my critical thinking, and prepared me for a career of problem-solving!</p>
